Layer 1: Physical
    Role: It is responsible for transmission and reception of unstructured raw data in a physical medium.
    Hardware: Hubs
    Unit: Bit
    Protocols: Ethernet / IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) / Bluetooth


Layer 2: Data Link
    Role: Provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes.
    Hardware: Switch
    Unit: Frame
    Protocols: ARP / PPP / VLAN


Layer 3: Network
    Role:
        Provides the means of transferring variable length data sequences from one node to another connected to the same network.
        It translates logical network address into physical machine address.
    Hardware: Router
    Unit: Packet
    Protocols: ICMP / IPv4 / IPv6 / GRE / OSPF


Layer 4: Transport
    Role:
        Provides the means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host via one or more networks,
        while maintaining the quality of service.
    Unit: Segment (tcp) / Datagram (udp)
    Protocols: TCP / UDP


Layer 5: Session
    Role:
        The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers.
        It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application.
    Unit: Data
    Protocols: BGP / SOCKS / NFS / PPTP / SMB


Layer 6: Presentation
    Role: 
    Unit: Data
    Protocols: TLS / SSL  


Layer 7: Application
    Role: User - Network interaction point
    Unit: Data
    Protocols: HTTP / HTTPS / BitTorrent / DNS / DHCP / FTP / IMAP / NTP / SSH
